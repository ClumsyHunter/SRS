# hello-world
This is a site to share your fastest time on a quest. Its split up into individual weapon classes and quests. Quests can be done solo or multiplayer and will even be divided between runs using relics and runs not using relics. These quest can be any official quest (i.e. not custom quests). Make sure to take a picture for proof showing your time, equipment and food buff. You're allowed to re-submit a time for a quest as many times as you like. Your time would then be put registered into the site recording the fastest times for the localised Monster Hunter games. Got any questions or queries? Ask Clumsy! Use %room join mhgh_runs over at the Monster Hunter Discord server to join the discussion room or submit times! You can also DM times to /u/HorseSkull on reddit or message them to @clumsy_hunter on Twitter.
